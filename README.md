# Getting Started with Angular 13 Word Processor

The [Angular Word Processor](https://www.syncfusion.com/angular-components/angular-word-processor?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-word-processor-github-samples) is a feature rich UI component with editing capabilities like Microsoft Word. Also known as the document editor, it is used to create, edit, view, and print Word documents. It provides all the common Word processing features including editing text, formatting contents, resizing images and tables, finding and replacing text, bookmarks, tables of contents, printing, and importing and exporting Word documents.
